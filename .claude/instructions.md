# Claude Code Multi-Agent Instructions for ABM Research

## Project Context

This is a PhD dissertation project on **Agent-Based Models for Statistical Sociology**, specifically focused on designing social norm interventions to promote interethnic cooperation through tolerance. The research employs sophisticated **Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs)** using RSiena with custom C++ effects.

### Research Objectives

1. **Primary Goal**: Design and test tolerance-based interventions that promote interethnic cooperation through social network dynamics
2. **Methodology**: SAOM/ABM using RSiena with custom attraction-repulsion mechanisms for friend-based social influence
3. **Innovation**: Custom C++ effects for complex contagion and friend-specific influence (not classroom-wide)
4. **Data**: 2,585 students across 105 classes in 3 German schools (3 waves)

### Key Constraints & Requirements

**Technical Requirements:**
- All modeling in R using RSiena package
- Custom C++ effects for friend-based attraction-repulsion influence
- Complex contagion effects requiring multiple simultaneous friend exposures
- Empirically calibrated parameters from real data
- Experimental simulation design testing multiple intervention strategies

**Academic Standards:**
- PhD-level methodological rigor
- Publication-ready statistical analysis
- Reproducible research protocols
- Proper handling of nested data (students → classes → schools)
- Theoretical grounding in social judgment theory and tolerance mechanisms

**Research Context:**
- Ethnic majority (German) tolerance toward ethnic minority (Turkish-German) practices
- School classroom social networks (friendship and cooperation ties)
- Intervention targeting strategies (popular students vs. norm entrepreneurs)
- Multiple intervention parameters (intensity, coverage, delivery strategy)

## Agent Coordination Principles

### Collaborative Development Model
1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different components
2. **Cross-Validation**: Each agent reviews others' work for methodological soundness
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on academic feedback
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Agents share theoretical insights and technical solutions

### Quality Assurance Protocol
1. **Statistical Validation**: All models must pass rigorous statistical tests
2. **Theoretical Coherence**: Implementations must align with social theory
3. **Reproducibility**: Complete documentation for independent replication
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient computation for parameter sweeps

### Communication Standards
- Use precise academic terminology for social network analysis
- Reference specific statistical methods and their assumptions
- Provide detailed explanations for methodological choices
- Include uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis

## Specialized Agent Roles

Each agent has specific expertise but collaborates on overlapping areas:

1. **SAOM Specialist**: RSiena modeling, C++ effects, network analysis
2. **Statistical Analyst**: Experimental design, hypothesis testing, effect validation
3. **Tolerance Theory Expert**: Social psychology integration, theoretical mechanisms
4. **Simulation Engineer**: Parameter sweeps, computational optimization, data management
5. **Research Methodologist**: Academic standards, reproducibility, publication protocols
6. **Code Quality Assurance**: Software engineering, testing, documentation
