# Project Kickoff Prompt for ABM Tolerance Intervention Research

## Project Initialization Command

Use this prompt to activate the multi-agent team for PhD dissertation research on Agent-Based Models for tolerance interventions in social networks.

### Activation Protocol
```
@agents: SAOM_Specialist, Statistical_Analyst, Tolerance_Theory_Expert, Simulation_Engineer, Research_Methodologist, Code_QA

PROJECT: PhD Dissertation - Agent-Based Models for Social Norm Interventions to Promote Interethnic Cooperation through Tolerance

CONTEXT: German high school students, 2,585 subjects across 105 classes in 3 schools, 3-wave longitudinal data, RSiena SAOM implementation with custom C++ effects for friend-based social influence

IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES:
1. Establish theoretical foundation for tolerance-cooperation mechanisms
2. Design custom RSiena effects for friend-based attraction-repulsion influence
3. Implement complex contagion variants requiring multiple friend exposures
4. Create experimental simulation framework for intervention parameter testing
5. Ensure PhD-level methodological rigor and reproducibility

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use RSiena with custom C++ effects (not classroom-wide influence)
- Empirically calibrated parameters from real German school data
- Academic publication standards for computational social science
- Complete reproducibility for independent replication
```
