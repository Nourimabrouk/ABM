Pro Tips for Using the Manual

Chapter 11 (Multilevel Analysis) is essential for polarization research across multiple groups
Section 11.3 on sienaBayes contains information not available anywhere else
Chapter 12 (Effects) provides mathematical definitions often missing from papers
Appendix B lists all convergence diagnostics and their interpretation
The manual is searchable but poorly indexed - use Ctrl+F liberally
