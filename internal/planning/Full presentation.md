• However, these interventions almost exclusively aim to achieve these outcomes by reducing individual-level prejudice (Paluck et al., 2021).

• Group-based prejudice, as the differential treatment of others because they belong to an ethnic out-group, is, of course, an important one.
• Another increasingly outlined motivation is people's principled disapproval of outgroup beliefs, values, and/or practices, which can worsen interethnic relations independently of prejudice (Verkuyten et al., 2023).

• For example, someone might oppose Muslim women wearing headscarves, not out of prejudice toward Muslims, but because they strongly endorse gender equality norms.
